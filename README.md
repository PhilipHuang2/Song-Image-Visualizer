# Song-Image-Visualizer
This is a short project between me and a friend.
The idea is the use two public APIs to make something to show on a website.

You should be able to enter a song and be given a slideshow of images from the Imgur API to look at while listening to the song.

My friend will work on the the backend with the APIs calls and the sorting.
I will be working on the frontend.  I am thinking about a react app with hosting from GitHub.
